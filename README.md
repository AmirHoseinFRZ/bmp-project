# bmp-project

### c project that process based on the given database to figure out the given numbers

on this project i used a c library named bmpio this library can process the images with bmp format([more about bmp images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format))

the program is designed that as it would be given some images as data then the program should process the images of single numbers then you can pass the program image of a time (simple time format -> hour:minute:seconds) so that the program can specify the given time

### bunch of 0 datasets:

and sum tests that they are in project files


as you see images have different sizes which means that the program should be able to work proberly with any imgae sizes (the main code has a helpfull commenting which can explain all you need to know about the code and algorithms in project)
